Ricardo L. Russ

Features:
Dynamically uses jQuery in order to check the time.
Thanks to the above functionality, the hours will change colors according to if they are before or after the current hour, while the present hour will be highlighted.
The header will also display the date and time the page is accessed. 
The planner is also fully customizable, thanks to the usage of textareas within the hour blocks. 
In addition, the planner will hold the inputted information in local storage until it is overwritten by the user or local storage is cleared.
Built using Bootstrap, so it is fully responsive across devices.
